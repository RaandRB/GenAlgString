genRun.py -> main program, runs genetic algorithm
fitness_functions.py -> functions related to the fitness evaluation in the genetic algorithm
functions.py -> help functions for the gen alg

Not as clean in reality but that is the idea.
solutionsXX.npy contains numpy arrays of solutions found for manifold XX
